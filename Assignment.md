# Front-end Code Assignment

## Intro
This assignment will be used as a discussion during a technical interview.
Time constraints are part of software development and even though we don't expect a perfect solution, imagine your code to be on its way to production.
If you have to make compromises, provide a README to briefly explain pros and cons of your approach, what considerations you would make for another iteration and in general what your 
future colleagues might be interested in if they had to pick up your code.

The primary values for the code we look for are: simplicity, readability, maintainability, testability. It should be easy to scan the code, 
and rather quickly understand what it’s doing. Pay attention to naming.

You may choose any (or no) frameworks and client technologies to accomplish this task.

This assignment will be followed by a discussion of your solution during a technical interview.

## The Task
The assignment is to implement a frontend for a warehouse solution’s API. A demo server can be found in warehouse-api.zip; 
setup instructions and API specification are in a file called README.md within that ZIP file. The API is occasionally unreliable, 
and your interface should cope with that.

The frontend should list the available products and quantities, and the articles in each product. The user should be able to register a sale, 
and the inventory should be updated accordingly.
